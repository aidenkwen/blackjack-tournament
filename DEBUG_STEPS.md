# Debug Steps for Player Search Issue

## Step 1: Check if players were uploaded correctly

1. Go to Supabase Table Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uhompzerslownizwqwoq/editor
2. Click on `tournament_players` table
3. Do you see your uploaded players there? 
4. Note down one player's account number and name

## Step 2: Check what the app is loading

1. Open your app: https://blackjack-tournament-7hcrmfiqr-aidens-projects-fe83db7a.vercel.app
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Go to your tournament registration page
5. In the console, type: `console.log('masterData:', window.masterData)`

## Step 3: Force check the context data

In the console, also try:
```javascript
// Check what tournament context has
console.log('Tournament context:', window.React?.findDOMNode?.());
```

## Step 4: Manual search test

Try searching for a player account number that you know exists in the database.

## Most Likely Issue

The problem is probably that:
1. Players are uploaded to Supabase ✅
2. But the app isn't loading them into `masterData` ❌
3. So when you search, `masterData` is empty

## Quick Fix

Let me create a simple test component to verify what's happening.
